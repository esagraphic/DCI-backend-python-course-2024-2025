# Python Debugging

# Task 1

You have been provided a function that loops over a list and returns the total of the values provided in the list

```
def get_total(lst):
    index = 0
    total = 0
    while index < len(lst):
        total += lst[index]
        index += 1

    print(total)

    return total
```

Spend some time introducing the debugger using 2 approaches

## First approach

Run debugger as a script

`python -m pdb file_name.py`

## Second approach

Add a break point to your code

## Steps for your experiment

Retrieve the following information

- A print out of the list of arguments of the function
- Navigate through the function using `n`
- Skip the while loop statement in your breakpoint to go to the line with the print statement
