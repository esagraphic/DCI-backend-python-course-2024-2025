# Timezones

## Working with timezones

In this exercise, we will focus on working across nations and boundaries when sending products (packages) or booking meetings with our friends and clients.

- Convert your birthdate in German local Time to the time in New Zealand (Auckland)
- Coordinate with your Team based in Ireland, San Francisco (USA), Berlin (Germany) and Johannesburg (South Africa). You will be having a meeting with another Team at 13:35 (Moscow Time). Print out the respective times your colleagues will be meeting

##

## Usage

`datetime`, `dateutil` should be used in the following way

```
from datetime import datetime
from datetuil import tz
from datetutil.relativedelta import *
```

##

## Tasks

###

### Task 1

- Use your birthday or a friend's

Hint: use `tz.gettz()` method to setup the timezone.

```
birthday = datetime(..., tzinfo=...)
...

birthday_in_newzealand = birthday.astimezone(...)
```

###

### Task 2

Your team is a multinational one meeting a regional leader based in Moscow, Russia, with the following regions:

- Dublin / Ireland
- San Francisco / USA

Irish participants will meet at: 11:35:00+01:00
German participants will meet at: 2021-08-01 12:35:00+02:00
